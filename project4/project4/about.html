                   <p>
                    Charleys Philly Steaks founder and CEO Charley Shin tasted his first Philly Cheesesteak back in 1985 while attending The Ohio State University. As a young undergrad with an appetite for success, Shin knew he wanted to share this sandwich experience with others in a big way. After experimenting with countless ingredients and perfecting his recipe, Shin turned his entrepreneurial dreams into reality in 1986 when he opened his first restaurant called Charley's Steakery, a 450-square foot space near The Ohio State University campus. With the support of his mother, Charley's Steakery became an instant hit with college students who craved the made-fresh Philly Cheesesteaks, loaded Gourmet Fries and all-natural Lemonades.

                   <p class="dark">
                    As the customers (and rave reviews) rolled in, Shin worked on a growth plan. In 1991, Charleys started franchising with like-minded partners to share the Philly Cheesesteak love. In 2002, Charley's Steakery became Charley's Grilled Subs, putting emphasis on our “grilled-fresh-in-front-of-you” transparency. In 2021, Charleys Cheesesteaks is serving our favorite cheesesteaks, fries, and real-fruit lemonades at every Charleys. Select locations also serve classic and boneless wings, fried appetizers, and frozen sweet treats.
